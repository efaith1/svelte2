You will choose one subtheme (i.e., one dataset) to conduct exploratory analysis using visualization, with a focus on understanding the shape & structure of the data, investigating initial questions, and developing preliminary insights & hypotheses.", "link":"A2.html"},
    {"title": "6.C35 Assignment 3: Visualization Design", "image": "images/three.png", "description": "In the previous assignment, you created a large number of visualizations but likely stuck with the default design choices the software package (e.g., Tableau) made. In this assignment, you will instead focus on these design choices by sketching 3 visualizations, and then crafting a single visualization from a small dataset. You should, in theory, be able to justify the contribution of every element of the visualization.", "link":"A3.html" },
    {"title": "6.C35 Assignment 4: Visualization Design", "image": "images/three.png", "description": "In this assignment, you will grapple with how to design visualizations ethically by crafting two different, opposing perspectives to the same question posed about a single dataset. Once this assignment is complete, we will (anonymously) peer review each other’s visualizations during a future lecture session.", "link":"A4.html" }
