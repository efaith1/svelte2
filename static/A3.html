			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p> <b>Question posed:</b> Do the census numbers show any clear patterns in how different age groups' and gender's populations changed over the 20th century?</p>

      <figure>

				</i></figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<b>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<b> Motivation:</b> The motivation behind using a time spiral is to communicate how 
				population distribution across age groups changed over time in a visually appealing and 
				easy-to-understand format.
				<b> What Worked Well:</b> The time spiral effectively conveys the changes in population 
				distribution over the 20th century.
				<b> What Didn’t work well:</b> While the time spiral effectively communicates the quantitative aspect 
				of the data, it may not provide detailed insights into specific gender dynamics within 
				age groups without additional annotation.
				<b> Next Exploration:</b> In the next sketch, I would like to explore a visualization 
				that offers more detailed insights into population dynamics within specific age groups, 
				perhaps through the use of a hierarchical or nested structure.
			</ul>
      <figure>

			</figure>

			<p>
				<b>Design Rationale for Sketch 2</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<b> Motivation:</b> The motivation behind using an age tree ring is to 
				visualize population changes over time in a hierarchical manner, 
				with each ring representing a different year and segments within each 
				ring representing different age groups. The goal is to provide a structured 
				and layered visualization that allows for a deeper exploration of population 
				dynamics within specific time periods and age groups, and provide an easier way to compare the difference between the two years.
				<b> What Worked Well:</b> The age tree ring effectively organizes the data 
				hierarchically and allows for a detailed examination of population changes 
				across both time and age groups.
				<b> What Didn’t:</b> While the age tree ring offers a structured view of the data, 
				it may become visually cluttered or difficult to interpret when dealing with a 
				large number of age groups or decades. It also does not include the gender dynamics within age groups.
				<b> Next Exploration:</b> In the next sketch, I would like to explore a 
				visualization that incorporates less cluttered visualization and more visually distinct representations that enable users to 
				explore specific age groups or time periods in more detail.
			</ul>

			<p>
				<b>Design Rationale for Sketch 3</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<b> Motivation:</b> The motivation behind using an age flow network 
				is to visualize population transitions between different age groups 
				over the two years. The goal is to illustrate the dynamic nature of population 
				flows across age groups, highlighting 
				key transitions and trends with more conspicuous visual encodings.
				<b> What Worked Well:</b> The age flow network captures the relational 
				aspect of population dynamics and allows for the identification 
				of significant transitions and trends over time.
				<b> What Didn’t:</b> While the age flow network offers insights 
				into population flows, it requires careful design to ensure 
				that the visualization remains comprehensible and interpretable, 
				especially when dealing with complex or overlapping transitions.
				<b> Next Exploration:</b> In the next sketch, I would like to explore 
				additional annotations to a visualization that can show me both the dynamics between 
				age groups and between genders while avoiding clutter and being very easy to interpret.</p>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        In reviewing the three sketches, each demonstrates distinct strengths and weaknesses. 
		The time spiral effectively captures quantitative changes but lacks detail. 
		The age tree ring provides hierarchical organization but risks visual clutter. 
		The age flow network offers relational insights but may be challenging to interpret. 
		In the next phase, I plan to synthesize elements from all sketches, aiming for a comprehensive visualization
		that can show me both the dynamics between age groups and between genders while avoiding clutter and still being very easy to interpret.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>
				<p>
					For the final visualization, I chose to create a population pyramid, a classic and intuitive way 
					to represent age and gender distributions within a population. To prepare the data, I binned 
					the census data provided into age groups and calculated the total population for each gender within each 
					age group.
					I then created calculated fields for male and female data to ensure that the gender dynamics were being explicitly 
					captured. Additionally, I color coded the two sums of the populations and reversed the axis of one of the genders, creating a population pyramid.
				</p><p>
					These transformations allowed me to focus on the relative distribution of age groups and gender 
					balance within the population pyramid. By arranging the age groups symmetrically around the central axis, the population pyramid effectively 
					highlighted differences in age and gender distributions across the 20th century. The story I am trying to tell is one 
					which shows clear patterns in how different age groups' and gender's total populations changed over the two years and how they compare, and I 
					think the population pyramid does the best job at conveying that.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Reflecting on phase one, the sketches provided valuable insights into different 
		visualization approaches and allowed me to experiment with unconventional designs. While I 
		ultimately chose a more traditional visualization for the final product, the exploration of 
		alternative designs influenced my decision-making process. For example, the hierarchical structure of the 
		age tree ring sketch inspired me to organize the age groups within the population pyramid in a systematic manner, 
		facilitating comparison and interpretation. The attempt at the age flow network emphasized the need for an easily interpretable design, and 
		all three sketches highlighted the need for a visualization with explicit expressiveness for the two genders represented in the data. 
		Overall, phase one helped me refine my understanding of the 
		data and informed my design decisions for the final visualization.
